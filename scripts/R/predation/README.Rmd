# Predation Submodel

The predation submodel attempts to split the difference between treating predators as an abstract risk field vs. creating predator agents (and thus greatly increasing model complexity).

## Generating predators

Predator presence and absence were evaluated using data collected in 2013--2014 by FISHBIO **[REFS]**. Briefly, transects starting 15 feet from shore and moving towards shore were electroshocked and all fish were collected. Afterwards, environmental data were collected from each transect, including percent cover from submerged vegetation and woody debris, presence/absence of shade, type of substrate, water depth (at 5 ft, 10 ft, and 15 ft from shore) and water velocity (at 5 ft, 10 ft, and 15 ft from shore). These data are appealing because they are similar in nature to the individual-based model setup; i.e., transects/model cells have their own unique local habitat qualities and are associated with the presence/absence of predators.

Before building the predator model, the data were cleaned and parsed. Vegetation and wood data were originally reported as percent ranges. The mean value of each range was used and converted to a proportion. Substrate classification varied from year to year, and the vast majority of values were either rocky or not; therefore, all substrate classifications that included "rocky" were simplified to "rocky". Gravel, which appeared very infrequently, was classified as "rocky". All other substrates were classified as "mud". Finally, water depth and velocity values were averaged (i.e., the respective values at 5, 10, and 15 ft from shore) to yield a single depth or velocity value per transect.

The model includes predictions for both smallmouth bass (*Micropterus dolomieu*) and Sacramento pikeminnow (*Ptychocheilus grandis*). However, data for smallmouth bass from 2013 included observations for other *Micropterus* spp. (listed as "black bass") whereas data in 2014 were broken down by species. For consistently, all black bass data from 2014 were pooled. Hereafter, references to "smallmouth bass" refer to pooled "black bass" data. Furthermore, data were divided by fish size (< 150 mm and > 150 mm). Due to the limited numbers of observations, these data were also pooled, although smaller fish likely are not piscivorous and may exhibit different behaviors and habitat choices than large conspecifics. Finally, because there were so few observations that included more than one predator, the original count data were transformed into presence/absence data.

The data for each predator were fit to generalized linear models with a logit link, as follows:

$$
logit(P_{predator}) = \beta_{0} x_{intercept} + \beta_{1} x_{veg} + \beta_{2} x_{wood} + \beta_{3} x_{shade} + \beta_{4} x_{substrate} + \beta_{5} x_{depth} + \beta_{6} x_{velocity}
$$

Models were fitted and evaluated using the `tidymodels` package suite in `R`. Data were split into training and testing sets using a 0.75 split (i.e., 75% of the data was placed in the training set). Because the data contained many absences relative to presences, the `step_rose` function from the `themis` package was used for upsampling the training set. The model was then fit to the training set and evaluated using the testing set.

```{r label = roc_fig, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "temperature vs relative predator activity level", out.width = '75%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here('scripts','R', 'predation', 'output', 'figs', 'pred_log_model', 'pred_roc_plots.jpg'))

```

```{r include = FALSE}
pred_folder <- here("scripts", "R", "predation")
source(file = here(pred_folder, "R", "pred_log_model", "figs", "make_figs_funcs.R"))
source(file = here(pred_folder, "R", "pred_log_model", "pred_param_data_cleaning.R")) # clean and load the data

get_mean_roc <- function(df, pred_species){
  build_model(combined_data, pred_species) %>% 
  collect_metrics() %>% 
    filter(.metric == "roc_auc") %>% 
    pull(mean)
}

count_preds <- function(df, pred_species, status){
  df %>% 
    filter((species == pred_species) & (count == status)) %>% 
    nrow()
}

bass_roc <- get_mean_roc(combined_data, "bass")
sasq_roc <- get_mean_roc(combined_data, "sasq")

sasq_pres <- count_preds(combined_data, "sasq", "present")
sasq_tot <- sasq_pres + count_preds(combined_data, "sasq", "absent")


```


Predictions for the bass model were relatively good (ROC area under the curve [AUC] = `r bass_roc %>% round(3)`), while those for Sacramento pikeminnow were more limited but better than guessing (ROC AUC = `r sasq_roc %>% round(3)`) (**Fig 1.**). The pikeminnow results were likely hampered by the limited number of observed individuals (`r sasq_pres` out of `r sasq_tot` total observations). The results for bass could have likely been improved with more observations specifically for smallmouth bass. Pooling large and small individuals as well as multiple species (i.e., "black bass") likely reduced the predictive power of the model.

Because the GLMs do not account for transect size, the predictions were rescaled relative to the sum of all cell predictions for a given species:

$$
P_{scaled_i} = P_{predator_i} / \sum_{i = 1}^{i=N} P_{predator_i}
$$

$P_{scaled}$ was then multiplied by the total number of predators in the system, $N_{pred}$, to yield the expected number of predators for a given cell. This value was used as a probability in the `rbinom` function in `R` to assign a predator to a cell. $N_{pred}$ is a reach value based on literature **[REF]** but can be adjusted by the user. In this way, predictions are scaled by the environment's number of predator relative to model's original prediction for the expected total number of predators, which also accounts for the effect of transect/cell size on the outcome. Additionally, depth and velocity can change daily, so predators are updated with environmental parameters, allowing for predator "movement"

## Effects of temperature
Predators are assumed to be stationary and can "interact" with prey that fall within their "reaction distance", which represents the maximum distance at which a predator might react to a prey item; i.e., predators are represented by a point and sweep out a circular area with a radius equal to their reaction distance. The probability of prey fish encountering a predator is thus the total area swept out by predators' reaction distance divided by the area of the cell.

The area of the this circle is modified by temperature. Data from various metabolic and activity studies of pikeminnow and bass were scaled and fit with a logistic model **TODO: [REFS] (Fig XXXX)**. The area of predator circles is scaled by the model to represent changing activity levels with changing temperature.

```{r label = temp_effect_fig, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "temperature vs relative predator activity level", out.width = '75%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here('scripts','R', 'predation', 'output', 'figs', 'pred_temperature_effects', 'temp_vs_pred_activity.jpg'))

```

**TODO:** Figure xxxx. Temperature vs relative predator activity level.

## Gape limitation
Although encounters between predator and prey are determined probabilistically based on the proportion of a cell occupied by predators, the outcomes of these interactions are governed by the size of the predator vs. the size of the prey. Predators are gape limited, and no lethal encounters occur when a prey fish exceeds the gape-limited maximum prey size of a predator. If, however, a prey fish is at or below the maximum prey-size threshold, a predation encounter can proceed. **TODO**: mention sturgeon explicitly. Predator sizes are drawn from a log-normal distribution fit to the predator length frequencies from the FISHBIO reports [REFS]. Maximum prey sizes are determined following **[REF]**. Because **[REF]** doesn't include Sacramento pikeminnow in its assessment, we treat all predators as smallmouth bass. Minimum predator size is set to 150 mm (i.e., fish have switched to piscivory) and the maximum size is set to the largest observed size from the FISHBIO reports.

## Effect of cover
The outcome a predator--prey encounter ($P_{survival}$) is determined by the base success rate of predators ($P_{pred \\_ success}$), which is a reach value that can be modified by the user, and the survival benefit of cover ($S_{cover}$) in the cell, as follows:

$$ 
P_{survival} = (1 - P_{pred \\_ success}) + P_{pred \\_ success}S_{cover} 
$$

The relationship between available cover and survival benefit was assessed based on the average distance to cover **TODO (Fig. xxxxx) [REF]**

```{r label = cover_benefits_fig, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "temperature vs relative predator activity level", out.width = '75%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here('scripts','R', 'predation', 'output', 'figs', 'cover_benefits', 'cover_benefits.jpg'))

```

**TODO** Fig. XXXXXX

```{r, include = FALSE}
df <- read_csv(
  here('scripts/R/predation/data/simulation/cover_simulation_data.csv'), 
  show_col_types = FALSE)

model_fit <- df %>%
  dplyr::select(pct_cover, mean_dis_w_0) %>% # mean_dis_w_0 is just one of the two simulations run; includes all values with 0 dis to cover
  tidyr::nest(data = dplyr::everything()) %>% # use the nesting trick to git a model
  dplyr::mutate(fit = purrr::map( # fit a polynomial: x^0.5 + x + x^1.5
    .x = data,
    .f = ~ stats::lm(
      mean_dis_w_0 ~ sqrt(pct_cover) * pct_cover,
      data = .
    )))

tidy_output <- model_fit %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(tidy = map(fit, tidy)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(tidy) %>% 
  tidyr::unnest(tidy) %>% 
  dplyr::select(term, estimate) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = term, values_from = estimate) %>% 
  rename(intercept = '(Intercept)',
         sqrt = 'sqrt(pct_cover)',
         poly_term = 'sqrt(pct_cover):pct_cover')

get_val <- function(df, val){
  df %>% 
    pull({{ val }}) %>% 
    round(2)
}


```


Although distance to cover was used as a proxy for safety from predators, representing this figure in the model cells is challenging, as only the percent cover value is available. Therefore, we simulated in `R` the distance to cover based on percent cover, as follows. First, cover was simulated as polygons of random placement, shape and size were generated in a $1 \times 1$ simulated cell **TODO**: (Fig. xxxx).

```{r label = polygon_fig, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "temperature vs relative predator activity level", out.width = '75%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here('scripts/R/predation/output/figs/cover_simulation/polygon_sim.jpeg'))

```

**TODO**: Fig xxxx. Example polygons

Points (n = 10,000) were then plotted randomly in each simulated cell **TODO (Fig. xxxx)** and their distance to the nearest polygon was measured. Points that fell within a polygon were considered to have a distance of 0. The mean value of these measurements was considered the mean distance to cover for a given cell. In total, `r nrow(df)` cells were simulated, varying in number and size of polygons to represent a wide range of possible cover configurations. Thus, the proportion of each cell that was occupied by cover could be associated with a distinct mean distance to cover. A polynomial function was fit to these data **TODO (Fig. xxxx)**:

$$
D_{cover} = `r get_val(tidy_output, intercept)` +`r get_val(tidy_output, sqrt)`\sqrt P_{cover} +`r get_val(tidy_output, pct_cover)`P_{cover} +`r get_val(tidy_output, poly_term)`{P_{cover}}^{1.5}
$$

where $P_{cover}$ is the proportion of cover in the cell and $D_{cover}$ is the mean distance to cover. 


```{r label = cover_sim_fit_fig, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "temperature vs relative predator activity level", out.width = '75%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here('scripts/R/predation/output/figs/cover_simulation/model_fit.jpeg'))

```

**TODO**: Fig. xxxxx

Because the simulations were conducted in $1 \times 1$ cells, predictions for distance to cover can simply be scaled for a given cell size. If a cell has 0% cover, we give no benefit to survival from cover during a predator--prey interaction, rather than using the model's prediction for a cover value of 0. Although this might be unrealistic because neighboring cells may offer some cover, this was not considered.
